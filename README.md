# PicPost

PicPost is a platform for sharing text, videos, and/or pictures with others. Currently, users can see all other posts on their home food (with most recent first), and make posts of their own

Right now, PicPost is being expanded to support user registration and custom account visibility

NOTE: the style.css containing the tailwindcss scheme has been removed while the project is transitioned to the CDN version
